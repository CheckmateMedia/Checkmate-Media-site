# Checkmate-Media-site
This code is used in the website for our company.
Much of what we will post on here will be HTML code with mostly inline CSS.  
We do use pure css files on occassion.  
We are trying to resolve some css issues and then we 
will begin oding a playable html chess game with JavaScript once we 
finish making the html CSS board.
